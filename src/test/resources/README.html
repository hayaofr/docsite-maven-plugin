<p>jExt is a simple library that allows you to define a <em>plug-in</em> architecture detecting the
    Java classes that implements a specific interface. It mostly relies on the standard
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html">extension mechanism provided</a> by Java by means of the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/11/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">ServiceLoader</a>
    class, but it simplifies and enhances the usage.</p>
<p>The key concepts are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Extension points</strong> (interfaces annotated with <code>@ExtensionPoint</code>) which define the contract</li>
    <li><strong>Extensions</strong> (classes annotated with <code>@Extension</code> and implementing the extension point class)</li>
    <li><strong>Extension loaders</strong> that are responsible of discovering extensions for an specific extension point</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the extra value then?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Annotation processing of <code>@Extension</code> and <code>@ExtensionPoint</code> so the classes are
        automatically registered as services by the compiler</li>
    <li>Capability of using multiple class loaders at the same time</li>
    <li>Use the default <code>ServiceLoader</code> mechanism or provide your own discoverer from a IoC framework</li>
    <li>Explicitly declaring the extension point version that implement each extension,
        avoiding using wrong jar versions</li>
    <li>Custom control about creating new extension instances or reusing existing ones</li>
    <li>When extending an extension via inheritance, you may either override the parent class or
        use both superclass and subclass independently</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Maven dependency</h3>
<p>Include the following within the <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;</code> section of your <code>pom.xml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.github.luiinge&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jext&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Quick start</h3>
<h4>Declaring a extension point</h4>
<p>Simply annotate an interface with <code>@Extension</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@ExtensionPoint
public interface MyExtensionPoint {

    List&lt;String&gt; provideStuff();

}
</code></pre>
<h4>Providing an extension</h4>
<p>Annotate a class implementing the interface with <code>@ExtensionPoint</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Extension(provider=&quot;my.company&quot;, name=&quot;my.extension&quot;, version=&quot;1.0&quot;)
public class MyExtension implements MyExtensionPoint {

    @Override
    public List&lt;String&gt; provideStuff() {
        return List.of(&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;carrot&quot;,&quot;lemon&quot;);
    }

}
</code></pre>
<h4>Consuming an extension point</h4>
<p>Use a <code>ExtensionManager</code> instance to get one or many implementations of the extension point:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">    ExtensionManager extensionManager = new ExtensionManager();
    // get one
    Optional&lt;MyExtensionPoint&gt; extension = extensionManager.getExtension(MyExtensionPoint.class);
    // get many
    Stream&lt;MyExtensionPoin&gt; extensions = extensionManager.getExtensions(MyExtensionPoint.class);
</code></pre>
<p>You can apply several filters (predicates) when asking for an extension, such as provider or
    specific versions.</p>
<h3>Scopes</h3>
<p>Each extension can define a specific scope that will be used to decide whether it is necessary to
    create a new instance or reuse an existing one. The available scopes are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>GLOBAL</code> : the same instance would be used along the lifetime of the application; this is the
        default scope when not specified</li>
    <li><code>LOCAL</code> : a new instance would be created each time the extension is requested</li>
    <li><code>SESSION</code> : the same instance would be used along the lifetime of the extension manager; if
        you create several managers, each one will reuse its own instance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>One major improvement over the regular <code>ServiceLoader</code> is avoiding version mismatches. Since
    Java does not have the concept of <em>version</em> at runtime, you can end up using an implementation
    version that is not aligned with the interface version. Thus, unexpected errors like
    <code>NoSuchMethodError</code> may occur without any further hint of what is happening.</p>
<p>Using <strong>jExt</strong> you can provide extra information in the annotations that helps to determine if an
    extension is suitable for an extension point. The <code>ExtensionPoint</code> annotation has the property
    <code>version</code>, used in the form of <code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;[.&lt;patch&gt;]</code>, and the <code>Extension</code> annotation
    has the property <code>extensionPointVersion</code> in the same manner. If the existing extension uses
    an extension point version that is not compatible with the actual extension point version, it
    will not be selected by the <code>ExtensionManager</code>, preventing this way potential errors.</p>
<p>If you do not care about versioning, just ignore it; version <code>1.0.0</code> will be used by default.</p>
<h3>Use your own extension loader</h3>
<p>The default behaviour of any declared extension is to be loaded by means of the <code>java.util.ServiceLoader</code>
    class. However, you can provide your own extension loading mechanism by creating a new
    class implementing the <code>jext.ExtensionLoader</code> interface.</p>
<p>Your custom extension loader have to be registered in the <code>ServiceLoader</code> registry,
    writing the fully qualified name of the class in the file <code>META-INF/services/jext.ExtensionLoader</code>.
    Package both files in a <code>jar</code> and include it in the classpath or modulepath along with the <code>jext</code>
    library in order to be accessible.</p>
<p>There are two constraints that external loaders should abide by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only retrieve extensions that are mark as <code>externallyManaged</code></li>
    <li>Honour the defined scope of the extension, returning new instances or reusing ones accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>A common scenario where custom extension loaders are required is the use of an <em>inversion of
        control</em> framework that manage the lifecycle of components on its own. Check the
        <a href="https://github.com/luiinge/jext-spring">jExt-Spring</a> project for an example of this.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<h4>Finalizing instances</h4>
<p>The internal extension loader keeps a cache of used extensions per session (that is, per instance
    of <code>ExtensionManager</code>). Due to the specifics of the Java finalization process and garbage
    collection, you must clear the cached objects manually once you are done ( by invoking
    <code>extensionManager.clear()</code> ). Otherwise, the cached objects would remain in memory indefinitely.
    That is not a problem when your extension manager is a singleton bound to the lifetime of the
    application, but if you are planning to use several instances of the extension manager, this
    becomes an issue to be aware of.</p>
<h4>Java modules</h4>
<p>When the Java Module System is present, extension points and extensions must be declared manually
    in your <code>module-info.java</code> file using <code>provides</code> directive. Although it partially defeats the
    purpose of fully automation, none straightforward solution can be applied to solve that, so
    the only outcome is live with it. Nonetheless, the compiler can detect the lack of the required
    directives in the module definition, and it will emit a warning message informing you of this
    situation, similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>[WARNING] [jext] at jext.MyExtensionV2_6 :: jext.MyExtensionV2_6 must be declared with the directive 'provides' in module-info.java in order to be used properly
</code></pre>
